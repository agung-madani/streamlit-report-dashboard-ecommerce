# Business Question 1
st.subheader("ðŸšš Business Question 1: How does product delivery performance impact customer satisfaction?")
st.markdown("""
To answer this question, we explored the relationship between delivery time, order status, and customer review scores. For this analysis, the **Orders** and **Order Reviews** datasets were utilized.

### Process:
1. **Calculated Delivery Time**: 
   - The delivery time for each order was computed as the difference between the `order_delivered_customer_date` and `order_purchase_timestamp`.
   - This gives the delivery duration in days.

2. **Merged Datasets**: 
   - The `Orders` and `Order Reviews` datasets were merged using `order_id` to combine review scores with delivery times and order statuses.

3. **Grouped Analysis**:
   - Delivery time statistics were calculated by grouping data by `order_status` and `review_score` to identify patterns.

### Insights:
The table below summarizes the delivery time statistics by order status and review score:

| Order Status | Review Score | Count  | Mean   | Std Dev | Min  | 25%  | Median | 75%  | Max   |
|--------------|--------------|--------|--------|---------|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| Delivered    | 1            | 9,405  | 20.85  | 16.06   | 0    | 9    | 16     | 30   | 195   |
| Delivered    | 2            | 2,940  | 16.19  | 12.49   | 1    | 8    | 13     | 22   | 208   |
| Delivered    | 3            | 7,960  | 13.79  | 9.94    | 0    | 7    | 12     | 18   | 188   |
| Delivered    | 4            | 18,983 | 11.85  | 8.29    | 0    | 7    | 10     | 15   | 194   |
| Delivered    | 5            | 57,050 | 10.22  | 6.82    | 0    | 6    | 9      | 13   | 187   |

### Key Observations:
- **Impact of Delivery Time on Customer Satisfaction**:
   - As the review score decreases, the mean delivery time increases, suggesting that customers who receive their products later tend to leave lower ratings.
   - Conversely, faster deliveries are associated with higher review scores.
   
- **Delivery Time Range**:
   - The minimum delivery time is 0 days (indicating some orders are delivered on the same day or very quickly).
   - The maximum delivery time is surprisingly high, with some orders taking more than 150 days to deliver, which may indicate outliers or exceptional cases.

This analysis reinforces the idea that improving product delivery times could significantly boost customer satisfaction.

# Business Question 2
st.subheader("ðŸ“ˆ Business Question 2: What are the regional sales patterns and product preferences?")
st.markdown("""
To address this question, we analyzed sales patterns and product preferences across different states using multiple datasets: **Orders**, **Customers**, **Geolocation**, **Order Items**, and **Products**.

### Process:
1. **Merging Datasets**:
   - The datasets were merged sequentially to combine information about orders, customers' geolocations, purchased items, and product details.
   - This created a comprehensive dataset containing 16,838,631 entries across 32 columns.
